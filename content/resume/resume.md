## Research and Technical Experience
* Joined the CMS collaboration in 2005. Research focus: search for physics beyond the Standard Model at the LHC, especially for Supersymmetry and Dark Matter.
    * Founding member of an analysis group with members from Fermilab/UCSD/UCSB, focusing on final states with leptons.
    * Supervised several Fermilab postdoctoral researchers:
        * Jacob Linac measuring top quark properties and searching for heavy top-like particles.
        * Matteo Cremonesi searching for Dark Matter.
        * Nick Smith analyzing Higgs boson decay channels, starting with the decay into two bottom quarks, and two charm quarks.


* Extensive experience in operating large distributed computing infrastructures: operated the entire CMS computing resources in LHC Run 1 leading up to the Higgs discovery with a team of 60 individuals distributed across the world
* Part of the worldwide community efforts to plan for the software and computing infrastucture for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC): I was an integral part of the community planning process and my input was documented in the [Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s](http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982). I was editor of the [HEP Software Foundation Community White Paper Working Group - Data Analysis and Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03983). My expertise in the community was acknowledged in 2020 when I was called upon to co-lead the [Computational Frontier](https://snowmass21.org/computational/start) of the [Particle Physics Snowmass 2021 process](https://snowmass21.org). Because the Snowmass process was delayed by one year, I needed to resign in 2022 due to previous high priority committments. I oversaw the process till a successor was appointed.

Unfortunately, I needed to resign from this important tasks at the beginning of 2022 because of other higher priority tasks that did not allow me to continue my involvement.
* My recent research interest in computing infrastructure explores if analysis in HEP can be conducted more efficiently using tools developed and used by industry. I am exploring using toolkits like [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and similar technologies. I created a research group spanning researchers from Fermilab, CERN and the Universities Princeton, Padova and Vanderbilt. The [CMS Big Data Project](https://cms-big-data.github.io/) also very closely works together with industry in a project with [Intel](https://www.intel.com/) in the context of [CERN openlab](https://openlab.cern/). I also managed a Laboratory Directed Research and Development project (LDRD) to develop innovative technology for Big Data delivery to array-based analysis code, the [Striped Data Server for Scalable Parallel Data Analysis](https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1085/4/042035). These projects lead to various projects like a user front-end to columnar data tools [COFFEA](https://github.com/CoffeaTeam) and supporting analysis activities funded through [IRIS-HEP](https://iris-hep.org/as.html).
* I am currently the U.S. CMS Software and Computing Operations Program manager enabling analysis of U.S. collaborators of the CMS experiment. I am overseeing the operation of the U.S. CMS Tier-1 site at Fermilab and 7 U.S. Tier-2 sites at Caltech, Florida University, MIT, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Purdue University, UC San Diego, Unversity of Wisconsin-Madison. I lead effort to administer the sites, maintain the computing infrastructure and conduct strategic R&D projects.
* In January 2020, the DOE [Center for Computational Excellence](https://www.anl.gov/hep-cce/activities) was funded for a 3-year project to enable HEP experiments like ATLAS, CMS, DUNE, LSST, DESI and others to efficiently use HPC installations in the U.S. at the leadership class facilities at Argonne and Oakridge National Laboratories and NERSC at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I co-wrote the proposal to execute 4 sub-projects and I was appointed technical lead of the sub-project to investigate parallel portability solutions.
